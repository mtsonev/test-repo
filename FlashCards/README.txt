This is a Flash Card program I am writing to study for my Qualifying Exams.
As such, it is entirely focused on my immediate needs (Anatomy Information),
but the base class and the manner in which I have coded the "Muscle" class
are easily extended to any other topic for which you might want to make
flash cards.

Due to the main objective being studying for quals rather than creating a
polished program, it is rough around the edges and assumes that you will
grade your own responses and merely input whether or not you were correct.

This is a work in progress, I plan to implement the ability to keep a record
of how well you do on the different aspects of each question, but getting all
of the information into the program (i.e., writing all of the flash
cards) is my first priority.
